# Notebook helps us to record entries and determine the frequency of any word and its similar words.

__Scope of the solution:__
This software determines the frequency of a word and finds similar words in a notepad entry. The text entered is retained only for the current session. Punctuation marks have not been considered; for example, cats and cat's are considered as the same word.
